This is an LG TV Weather app that uses WebOS 2.0 version.
This project is a simple HTML, CSS & JS weather web app.
I have used embedded Google fonts, XHR for network calls and primitive CSS styling as my LG TV is old ( bought in 2016 ) and does not support mordern CSS or JS functions.

### *Things to be changed*

1. Insert your latitude and longitude in script.js file.
2. Add your own weather videos in the assets folder.

I have saved my custom videos in the assets folder but if you don't want to add videos and increase the size of your app then you can use iframe and stream a youtube video directly as background video.

Below is a video of how it looks and works.
I have used webOS 6.0 simulator for development as for versions below this, only emulator is available and I didn't want to create a VM.
