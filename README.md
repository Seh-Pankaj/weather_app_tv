This is an LG TV Weather app that uses WebOS 2.0 version.
This project is a simple HTML, CSS & JS weather web app.
I have used embedded Google fonts, XHR for network calls and primitive CSS styling as my LG TV is old ( bought in 2016 ) and does not support mordern CSS or JS functions.

Below is a video of how it looks and works.
I have used webOS 6.0 simulator for development as for versions below this, only emulator is available and I didn't want to create a VM.
